# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning App

This website is an interactive machine learning app designed to classify penguin species based on user-provided features such as island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and gender.

Users can input these features using intuitive sliders and dropdowns, and the app predicts the penguin species using a trained Random Forest model. It also displays the prediction probabilities for each species and allows users to explore and visualize the underlying dataset, making it an engaging tool for understanding machine learning in action.
